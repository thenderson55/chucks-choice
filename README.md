# About Chuck's Choice

Chuck's Choice is a humorous SPA created over 2 days by Florin Mavroian, Thomas Henderson and Ben Dyer during the Code Chrysalis Immersive Bootcamp in May 2019.

The challenge was to build an application using as many APIs as possible from the Rakuten Rapid API service, and then present the app to leaders from the Rapid API team at Rakuten Crimson House Headquarters.

## Idea

The "Coolest API" of 2019 is the Chuck Norris API for random Chuck Norris quotes, while the most popular API avaiable on Rakuten Rapid API is Skyscanner. To combine these two premier APIs we made *Chuck's Choice* - Chuck Norris chooses.

## Getting Started 

### Dependencies

The frontend was written in React, and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
